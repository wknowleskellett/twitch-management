# Twitch Management
This should be a basic bot that allows for the creation of dynamic websites
that OBS can use to show my chat, as well as viewer count.

These sites will also be usable by [Transparent Twitch Chat Overlay](https://github.com/baffler/Transparent-Twitch-Chat-Overlay) or whatever else.

## Reasoning
Streamlabs has this. But, (and I forget why,) I don't like Streamlabs, they had bad business practices or something. Since I've got a droplet anyway, might as well run a bot to serve up some widgets. So that's where we're at.
